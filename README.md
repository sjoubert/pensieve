Pensieve
========

Pensieve is a (hopefully) simple todo-list-like application suite.

The server is designed to store a list of elements with a title, a description and some user tags.
Then each client instance can display these elements using custom filter rules.

The suite contains:

 * A common library
 * A HTTP server
 * A graphical client
